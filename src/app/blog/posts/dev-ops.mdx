## Introduction

For our group project, we enhanced a Bookstore API by implementing modern DevOps practices. The goal was to automate testing, building, and deployment using **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and **Google Cloud Platform**‚Äîresulting in a secure, scalable pipeline.

We‚Äôll walk through every step: from setting up CI, writing API tests with **Jest**, managing secrets, to deploying on **Cloud Run**.

---

## Setting up Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions helps automate workflows like testing and deployment. We used it to run linting and unit tests on every push and pull request.

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  highlight="1-2,6-7,18-24"
  codes={[
  {
    code: `name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: ["main"]
  pull_request:
    branches: ["main"]

jobs:
  main:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      mysql:
        image: mysql:8.0
        env:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: \${{ secrets.MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD }}
          MYSQL_DATABASE: bookstore_test
        ports:
          - 3306:3306

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18.20.5
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
        env:
          DATABASE_HOST: 127.0.0.1
          DATABASE_PORT: 3306
          DATABASE_USER: root
          DATABASE_PASSWORD: \${{ secrets.MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD }}
          DATABASE_NAME: bookstore_test`,
    language: "yaml",
    label: ".github/workflows/ci.yml"
  }
]} />

This pipeline gave our team early feedback on changes, ensuring a more stable and collaborative development experience.

## Containerizing the Application with Docker

Docker ensures consistent app behavior across machines by packaging it with dependencies.

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  highlight="1,5,10"
  codes={[
  {
    code: `FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --omit=dev

COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]`,
    language: "Dockerfile",
    label: "Dockerfile"
  }
]} />

### Testing Locally

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  codes={[
  {
    code: `docker build -t bookstore-api .
docker run -p 8080:8080 bookstore-api`,
    language: "bash",
    label: "Local Test"
  }
]} />

Containerization allowed each team member to run the same environment, reducing bugs and simplifying deployment.

## Deploying the Application to Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

We used three main services from GCP:

- **Cloud SQL**: managed MySQL for our data layer  
- **Cloud Build**: built and deployed our Docker images  
- **Cloud Run**: serverless container hosting with HTTPS and auto-scaling  

## Service Configuration Screenshots

### Why GCP?

- Reliable, automated releases  
- Built-in monitoring  
- Simplified infrastructure management  
- Easy rollback and scaling

## Writing API Tests with Jest

We used [Jest](https://jestjs.io) to test our API routes. These tests ran in our CI pipeline to catch regressions before deployment.

<CodeBlock
  marginBottom="16"
  highlight="2,4-6,9-12"
  codes={[
  {
    code: `describe('Books API', () => {
  it('should fetch all books', async () => {
    const res = await request(app).get('/books');
    expect(res.statusCode).toEqual(200);
    expect(Array.isArray(res.body)).toBe(true);
  });

  it('should fetch correct book by ID', async () => {
    const res = await request(app).get('/books/1');
    expect(res.body.title).toBe("Book Title 1");
  });
});`,
    language: "js",
    label: "tests/bookRoutes.test.js"
  }
]} />

Tests increased our confidence and allowed us to safely refactor our backend.

## Managing Secrets in Every Environment

We ensured secure and environment-specific secret handling:

- **Local**: `.env` file (excluded from Git)  
- **CI**: GitHub Actions secrets  
- **Production**: GCP Secret Manager + Cloud Run environment variables  

This protected sensitive information while keeping the setup reproducible.

## Challenges and Future Improvements

### üîê GCP IAM Configuration

Setting correct **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** roles on GCP was tricky at first. We followed the **principle of least privilege** to minimize risks.

**Solution:**  
We documented IAM role setups, separated deployment from testing accounts, and created scoped permissions.

### üß™ Test Coverage & Integration Tests

We focused mainly on unit tests. In the future, we plan to:

- Add integration tests that hit the live database  
- Increase test coverage reports in CI  
- Add performance benchmarking before release  

---

## Conclusion

This project gave us real-world experience with DevOps workflows. We combined:

- **CI/CD** via GitHub Actions  
- **Docker** for containerized builds  
- **Jest** for test-driven development  
- **GCP** for secure and scalable hosting  

By building a fully automated pipeline, we improved reliability, reduced manual errors, and delivered faster.
