## Overview

**Moments & Lens** is a modern photography portfolio website built for professional photographer **Samir Chaulagain**. The goal was to design a fast, clean, and visually compelling site that showcases Samir’s work, improves online visibility, and attracts new clients.

## Key Features

- **Responsive Gallery**: Created an image-rich, fully responsive gallery with categories for events, portraits, landscapes, and more — optimized for both mobile and desktop experiences.
- **Client-Friendly CMS**: Integrated a lightweight content editing workflow using static Markdown or CMS hooks (optional future feature).
- **SEO & Performance Optimized**: Used Next.js features like image optimization, dynamic routes, and meta tags for high search engine visibility and fast load times.
- **Contact & Booking**: Built a user-friendly contact form and direct booking integration for inquiries and session scheduling.
- **Minimalist UI**: Designed with a clean, elegant interface using Tailwind CSS to highlight photography without distraction.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For server-rendered, high-performance frontend architecture.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first responsive styling with clean design aesthetics.
- **Cloudinary API**: For high-quality storage of images.
- **Vercel**: For fast deployment and global CDN support.

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was curating and compressing high-resolution photos without sacrificing visual quality. To solve this, we leveraged Next.js Image components with optimization settings. Another learning point was balancing visual flair with load performance — especially on mobile networks — which informed careful UI choices.

## Outcome

The final website not only reflects the elegance and professionalism of Samir's photography, but also serves as a lead-generating portfolio with better visibility, fast load times, and a modern design. It’s a scalable foundation that can grow with the brand as new collections and services are added.
