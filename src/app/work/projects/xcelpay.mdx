## Overview

**XcelPay.io** is a decentralized crypto payment platform that allows users to send, receive, and store cryptocurrency securely. As a **Frontend Developer**, I was responsible for enhancing the platform’s web interface to ensure a seamless experience for crypto users and merchants alike.

## Key Contributions

- **User Interface Revamp**: Improved the responsiveness and UX of key pages including the wallet dashboard, transaction history, and token swap screens.
- **Wallet Integration**: Collaborated with backend teams to ensure smooth interaction with Ethereum and BSC wallets using **Web3.js** and **Ethers.js**.
- **Performance Optimization**: Reduced initial page load times by optimizing React components, lazy loading, and image compression strategies.
- **Security Best Practices**: Helped implement secure UI patterns for sensitive operations like wallet creation, recovery phrase handling, and token transfers.
- **Mobile-First Design**: Focused on mobile usability to support the growing mobile crypto user base.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js + Next.js**: For frontend architecture and server-side rendering.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For scalable and consistent design implementation.
- **Web3.js / Ethers.js**: For blockchain wallet interactions.
- **Redux**: For handling global state across wallet views and transaction flows.
- **Vercel** *(or internal CI/CD tools)*: For deployment and preview environments.

## Challenges and Learnings

Navigating the complexity of real-time blockchain data (pending, failed, or confirmed transactions) while keeping the interface intuitive was a key challenge. I learned how to build crypto-aware UI logic that adapts based on transaction state, and how to test those flows securely.

## Outcome

The updated platform delivered a smoother and more reliable experience for both users and merchants. My work contributed to higher user retention, better device compatibility, and faster access to core wallet features — supporting XcelPay.io's mission of making crypto payments more accessible.
