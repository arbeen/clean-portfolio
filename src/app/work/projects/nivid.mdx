## Overview

**Nivid** is a full-featured **school management system** designed to simplify and digitize operations for educational institutions. From student attendance and results to staff scheduling and fee collection, the system centralizes data and improves daily workflows.

As a **Frontend Developer**, I contributed to building user-facing modules and optimizing data-heavy pages for performance and clarity.

## Key Contributions

- **Student & Staff Dashboards**: Developed dynamic dashboards for students, teachers, and admins, displaying relevant data in a clean, role-based UI.
- **Attendance & Grading Interface**: Built interactive forms and views for taking attendance, entering grades, and generating progress reports.
- **Timetable & Calendar Views**: Implemented schedule components using calendar libraries and custom grid layouts.
- **Performance Optimization**: Worked with backend developers to improve data-fetching patterns and reduce UI lag in large data tables.
- **DevOps & QA Support**: Assisted in testing, bug fixing, and deploying builds using Git, CI pipelines, and staging environments.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js / JavaScript**: For building reusable UI components and managing state.
- **Bootstrap / Tailwind CSS**: For consistent, responsive design across modules.
- **Axios / REST APIs**: For communicating with backend services.
- **PostgreSQL / MySQL**: Worked with sample data and queries for frontend test environments.
- **Git + CI/CD Tools**: For version control and collaborative development.

## Challenges and Learnings

Designing UI flows that worked across multiple user roles (students, teachers, admins) required extra attention to permission handling and dynamic rendering. I learned how to make component logic adaptable and how to build tools that scale with institutional complexity.

## Outcome

Nivid was successfully adopted by multiple institutions, streamlining everything from admissions to classroom management. My frontend work helped ensure that users could navigate and manage school operations quickly, even with large datasets and varying device types.
